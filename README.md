# Mastermind_terminal

Mastermind guessing game. this took way way longer than I thought it would have (especially trying to figure out how to make the computer guess). I intentionally decided not to research methods and eventually modified a python solution for the computer Ai guess

## Description 

The game is played between two player, where  one is the code maker and the other the code guesser. The code maker make a guess of n-number of items and with the aid of hints, the code breaker tries to guess the code that was made by the code maker.
Hint: if a guess consist of a correct item in the correct positon, black is returned
      if a guess consists of a correct item in the worng position, white is returned
      ie [red, black, blue, yellow, red] vs [blue, white, blue, yellow, green]
       => [black, black, white] # returned as hint
